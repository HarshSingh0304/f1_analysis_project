    "# 📓 Notebook 05 — Undercut Detection & Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Context: Why This Notebook Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 04 marked a decisive transition in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its conclusion, we achieved something rare in sports analytics pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A lap-level dataset that is temporally explicit, structurally validated, and free of hidden inference.**\n",
    "\n",
    "All upstream concerns have now been resolved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data ingestion is complete\n",
    "- Schema ambiguity has been eliminated\n",
    "- Relational integrity is enforced\n",
    "- Lap grain is immutable\n",
    "- Time is continuous and monotonic\n",
    "- Track status is mechanically aligned\n",
    "- Pit structure and stints are explicitly defined\n",
    "- Silent analytical corruption has been ruled out via invariant enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we are no longer asking:\n",
    "> *“Can we trust the data?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now in a position to ask:\n",
    "> **“What does the data actually say?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 is where the **core question of this project is finally addressed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Central Question of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivating question behind this entire analysis is simple to state, but difficult to answer rigorously:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Is the undercut a consistently valuable race strategy in modern Formula 1 — or is its reputation largely hype?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering this requires more than anecdotal examples or selective race replays.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires:\n",
    "- precise definitions\n",
    "- controlled comparisons\n",
    "- explicit assumptions\n",
    "- repeatable evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 is where those requirements are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What “Undercut” Means in This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, it is crucial to clarify the **analytical framing** of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is **not** concerned with:\n",
    "- how teams *intend* to undercut\n",
    "- radio messages or strategy calls\n",
    "- post-race narratives\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it focuses on **observable outcomes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Given two drivers on track, when one pits earlier and rejoins, does that decision produce a measurable net advantage once pit-cycle effects are accounted for?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "- Undercut is treated as a **measurable event**\n",
    "- Success or failure is defined **empirically**\n",
    "- Evaluation is done **after the fact**, not inferred from intent\n",
    "\n",
    "This framing is essential to avoid circular reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Why Undercut *Detection* Comes After Notebook 04\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 04 deliberately avoided all strategy logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was not a limitation — it was a prerequisite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undercut detection **requires**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean lap-to-lap deltas\n",
    "- Accurate pit and out-lap identification\n",
    "- Correct stint segmentation\n",
    "- Reliable gap-to-leader and relative timing\n",
    "- Explicit track-status context\n",
    "- Confidence that ambiguous data has not been silently “fixed”\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are now guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, Notebook 05 can operate without:\n",
    "- defensive coding\n",
    "- implicit assumptions\n",
    "- hidden data cleaning steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes Notebook 04’s guarantees as **axioms**, not hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 Analytical Scope of Notebook 05\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 has a **precise and limited scope**, aligned with the pipeline document.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will do **three things**, and only three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Detect Undercut Events 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will identify **candidate undercut situations**, defined operationally by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative track position before pit cycles\n",
    "- Early pit stop by one driver relative to a competitor\n",
    "- Overlapping stint transitions\n",
    "- Comparable race context (same race, same lap window)\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection will be:\n",
    "- rule-based\n",
    "- deterministic\n",
    "- reproducible\n",
    "\n",
    "No subjective labeling will be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Evaluate Undercut Outcomes 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "For each detected undercut event, this notebook will evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Net time gained or lost after the pit cycle\n",
    "- Position changes attributable to the pit timing\n",
    "- Lap windows over which the outcome materializes\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation will:\n",
    "- use only green-flag competitive laps (as explicitly defined here)\n",
    "- exclude pit laps and out laps by construction\n",
    "- control for obvious confounders (e.g., safety cars)\n",
    "\n",
    "This step turns “undercut” from a narrative into a **measured quantity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Aggregate & Interpret Results 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Notebook 05 will aggregate undercut outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- across races\n",
    "- across seasons\n",
    "- across compounds\n",
    "- across stint lengths\n",
    "- across grid positions\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is **not** to cherry-pick examples, but to observe **distributions and tendencies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only at this stage will interpretation begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 Handling Track Status Ambiguity (Explicitly)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 04 intentionally allowed ambiguity in track status alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 resolves that ambiguity **explicitly**, not implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "- define what constitutes a *competitive green lap*\n",
    "- exclude laps affected by SC, VSC, or red flags\n",
    "- justify exclusions transparently\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a conscious analytical choice, not a data-cleaning hack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 What This Notebook Will *Not* Do\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain analytical discipline, Notebook 05 will **not**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- modify upstream features\n",
    "- redefine lap grain\n",
    "- reclassify pit laps\n",
    "- infer driver intent\n",
    "- speculate on team strategy calls\n",
    "\n",
    "All inputs are treated as fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an assumption is required, it will be:\n",
    "- stated explicitly\n",
    "- tested where possible\n",
    "- discussed in limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of Notebook 05, we expect to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A catalog of detected undercut events\n",
    "- Quantified outcomes for each event\n",
    "- Summary statistics describing undercut effectiveness\n",
    "- Evidence for or against the “undercut advantage” hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The results may confirm, weaken, or outright contradict common F1 strategy narratives.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to accept any of those outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why This Notebook Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Undercut strategy is often discussed as if its effectiveness were self-evident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 treats that belief as a **testable hypothesis**, not a given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the rigor enforced in Notebooks 00–04:\n",
    "\n",
    "- any conclusion reached here is grounded\n",
    "- any limitation is visible\n",
    "- any disagreement can be traced back to explicit choices\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the project stops preparing to analyze —  \n",
    "and starts **actually analyzing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Road Ahead\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the analytical core of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent notebooks, if any, will focus on:\n",
    "- robustness checks\n",
    "- sensitivity analysis\n",
    "- alternative definitions\n",
    "- extensions or counterfactuals\n",
    "\n",
    "But none of that is possible unless **this notebook is done correctly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the foundation sealed, we now proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notebook 05 begins here.**\n"

    "# 🏁 Notebook 05 — Conclusion  \n",
    "## Undercut Detection, Evaluation & Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 is where this project crossed the line from **feature engineering** into **strategy analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to Notebook 04, the focus was on building a clean, deterministic, lap-level analytical foundation. Notebook 05 deliberately restricted itself to **one question only**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Is the undercut strategy actually worth it, or is it largely hype?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook did not attempt to answer that question narratively or heuristically. Instead, it constructed a pipeline that could **defend its answer under scrutiny**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What Notebook 05 Set Out to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline document defined five conceptual stages for undercut analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formalize what an undercut is**  \n",
    "2. **Detect undercut candidates**  \n",
    "3. **Construct fair evaluation windows**  \n",
    "4. **Evaluate outcomes quantitatively**  \n",
    "5. **Handle edge cases and validate assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 implemented all five — but not always in the naïve way originally imagined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important lesson of this notebook is that **real data forces clarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Step-by-Step: What We Actually Did\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Undercut Definition (Cell 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "An undercut was formally defined as a **pairwise strategic interaction**, not a driver-level event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each undercut is uniquely identified by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `race_id`\n",
    "- `attacking_driver`\n",
    "- `defending_driver`\n",
    "- `pit_lap`\n",
    "\n",
    "This immediately ruled out vague notions like *“Driver X attempted an undercut”* and replaced them with:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Driver A attempted to undercut Driver B on lap L in race R.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision shaped everything downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Candidate Detection (Cell 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "We initially attempted to detect only “clean” undercuts (green-flag, racing context).  \n",
    "This **failed completely**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The failure was not a bug — it revealed a flawed assumption:\n",
    "- Track status data is **event-based and sparse**\n",
    "- Treating `is_green_lap == True` as “racing” was overly strict\n",
    "- Enforcing interpretation at detection destroyed signal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correction:**  \n",
    "Candidate detection was made **lossless and inclusive**:\n",
    "- Same race\n",
    "- Same pit lap\n",
    "- Attacker pits earlier than defender\n",
    "- Defender is still on track\n",
    "\n",
    "This produced **1,740 raw undercut candidates**, which is exactly what a detection stage should do.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Evaluation Window Construction (Cell 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next challenge was constructing **fair, like-for-like post-pit comparison windows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, enforcing green-flag logic too early resulted in **zero evaluable events**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:**  \n",
    "Green-flag status is not a *mechanical property* — it is an **analytical validity condition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we changed strategy:\n",
    "- Window construction enforced only **mechanical comparability**\n",
    "  - same laps\n",
    "  - no pit laps\n",
    "  - no out laps\n",
    "- Track status flags were **carried forward**, not used as filters\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduced 1,740 candidates down to **122 undercuts with valid evaluation windows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduction was not data loss — it was **data qualification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Outcome Evaluation (Cell 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we finally measured outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three metrics were computed deliberately:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary (Option B):**  \n",
    "  Mean net time delta across post-pit laps  \n",
    "  → *Does the undercut pay off on average?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secondary (Option A):**  \n",
    "  First post-pit lap delta  \n",
    "  → *Does the undercut feel immediately effective?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secondary (Option C):**  \n",
    "  Best lap delta in the window  \n",
    "  → *What is the peak upside (the “highlight” effect)?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the **primary metric** was allowed to determine `undercut_success`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoided cherry-picking while still allowing insight into why undercuts are hyped.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ Edge Case Handling & Green-Flag Enforcement (Cell 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline document stated:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Undercuts are meaningless under neutralized racing.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This was implemented **explicitly**, not implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of assuming green-flag conditions, we:\n",
    "- flagged any undercut whose evaluation window overlapped SC / VSC / RED laps\n",
    "- classified undercuts as `green_flag_valid` or not\n",
    "- compared outcomes **with and without enforcement**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:**  \n",
    "All 122 evaluable undercuts were already green-flag clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was surprising — but crucially, it was **proven**, not assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 😮 What Surprised Us\n",
    "\n",
    "Several non-obvious truths emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most “potential undercuts” never become evaluable events\n",
    "- Strict interpretation too early destroys analytical signal\n",
    "- Green-flag enforcement matters — but only **after** measurement exists\n",
    "- Many undercuts that *look* promising never survive fair comparison\n",
    "- The hype around undercuts is driven more by **best-case laps** than by **average outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are exactly the kinds of insights this project was designed to surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 What the Data Now Safely Says\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of Notebook 05, we now have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **122 validated undercut events**\n",
    "- Each with:\n",
    "  - pairwise context\n",
    "  - time-based outcomes\n",
    "  - success classification\n",
    "  - green-flag validation\n",
    "- Results persisted to:\n",
    "  - PostgreSQL (for BI)\n",
    "  - `data/final/` (for auditability)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any claim made downstream is now traceable to raw laps, explicit rules, and validated assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Final Artifacts Produced\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 produces **final, canonical outputs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PostgreSQL tables**\n",
    "  - `undercut_events`\n",
    "  - `undercut_summary`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filesystem artifacts**\n",
    "  - `data/final/undercut_events.parquet`\n",
    "  - `data/final/undercut_summary.parquet`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are **strategy-level facts**, not intermediate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What Comes Next (Notebook 06)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 06 is **not analysis** — it is **communication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The job of Notebook 06 (Power BI) is to:\n",
    "- visualize primary vs secondary metrics\n",
    "- contrast perception vs reality\n",
    "- show why undercuts feel powerful\n",
    "- show whether they actually are\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Notebook 05 was disciplined, Notebook 06 can now be honest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧾 Final Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 did not confirm or deny a narrative upfront.  \n",
    "It built a system that forced the narrative to **earn its place**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every failure refined assumptions.  \n",
    "Every correction improved rigor.  \n",
    "Every result is defensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the question *“Is the undercut worth it?”*  \n",
    "is no longer philosophical — it is empirical.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the data is finally ready to speak.\n"
