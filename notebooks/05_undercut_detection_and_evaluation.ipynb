    "# 📓 Notebook 05 — Undercut Detection & Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 Context: Why This Notebook Exists\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook represents the analytical core of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Notebook 04, the pipeline achieved a rare but necessary state for serious strategy analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A lap-level dataset that is temporally explicit, structurally validated, and free of hidden inference.**\n",
    "\n",
    "All upstream uncertainty has been deliberately resolved or made visible:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data ingestion is complete and reproducible\n",
    "- Schema ambiguity has been eliminated\n",
    "- Relational integrity is enforced\n",
    "- Lap grain is immutable\n",
    "- Time is explicit, continuous, and physically monotonic\n",
    "- Track status is mechanically aligned as an event overlay\n",
    "- Pit structure and stints are explicitly defined\n",
    "- Silent analytical corruption has been ruled out through invariant enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, this project is no longer asking:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Can the data be trusted?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "That question has already been answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 exists to answer a different, harder question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **“Given trustworthy data, what does it actually show?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Central Question of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivating question behind this analysis is simple to state, but difficult to answer rigorously:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Is the undercut a consistently valuable race strategy in modern Formula 1 — or is its reputation largely hype?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question cannot be answered through:\n",
    "- isolated race examples\n",
    "- selective replays\n",
    "- team narratives\n",
    "- or anecdotal intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires:\n",
    "- precise definitions\n",
    "- controlled comparisons\n",
    "- explicit assumptions\n",
    "- repeatable, falsifiable evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 is where those requirements are finally met.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What “Undercut” Means in This Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any detection or evaluation occurs, the analytical framing must be made explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, an undercut is **not** defined by:\n",
    "- team intent\n",
    "- radio messages\n",
    "- strategic labels applied post-race\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it is treated as an **observable, measurable sequence of events**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operationally, the question asked is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Given two drivers in comparable race context, when one pits earlier and rejoins, does that timing decision produce a measurable net advantage once the pit cycle completes?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Key implications of this framing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Undercut is evaluated **after the fact**\n",
    "- Success or failure is defined **empirically**\n",
    "- No inference is made about intent\n",
    "- No narrative assumptions are baked in\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids circular reasoning and confirmation bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Why Undercut Detection Comes After Notebook 04\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 04 intentionally excluded all strategy logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "That exclusion was not a limitation — it was a prerequisite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undercut detection requires, at minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean cumulative lap timelines\n",
    "- Accurate pit and out-lap identification\n",
    "- Correct stint segmentation\n",
    "- Reliable relative timing between drivers\n",
    "- Explicit track-status context\n",
    "- Confidence that missing or ambiguous data has not been silently “fixed”\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are now guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Notebook 05 can proceed without:\n",
    "- defensive data cleaning\n",
    "- hidden assumptions\n",
    "- implicit corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of Notebook 04 are treated here as **axioms**, not hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 Analytical Scope of Notebook 05\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 has a **deliberately narrow and controlled scope**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will do **three things**, and only three things.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Detect Candidate Undercut Events 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will identify **candidate undercut situations** using explicit, rule-based criteria, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relative on-track proximity before pit cycles\n",
    "- An earlier pit stop by one driver relative to a direct competitor\n",
    "- Overlapping or adjacent stint transitions\n",
    "- Comparable race context (same race, bounded lap window)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every early pit qualifies as an undercut attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection is conditional, conservative, and deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "No subjective labeling is introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Evaluate Undercut Outcomes 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "For each detected undercut candidate, the notebook will evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Net time gained or lost after the pit cycle completes\n",
    "- Position changes attributable to pit timing\n",
    "- The lap window over which the outcome materializes\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use only explicitly defined competitive green laps\n",
    "- Exclude pit laps and out laps by construction\n",
    "- Exclude laps affected by SC, VSC, or red flags\n",
    "- Avoid attributing causality where confounders dominate\n",
    "\n",
    "This step turns “undercut” from a narrative concept into a **measured quantity under controlled conditions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Aggregate & Interpret Results 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, undercut outcomes will be aggregated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Across races\n",
    "- Across seasons\n",
    "- Across compounds\n",
    "- Across stint lengths\n",
    "- Across grid positions\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is not to cherry-pick successful examples, but to observe **distributions, tendencies, and failure rates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only at this stage does interpretation begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚦 Handling Track Status Ambiguity (Explicitly)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 04 preserved track-status ambiguity rather than resolving it prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 resolves that ambiguity **explicitly and transparently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define what constitutes a competitive green lap\n",
    "- Justify the exclusion of SC, VSC, and red-flag laps\n",
    "- Apply these definitions consistently across all events\n",
    "\n",
    "These are analytical choices, not data-cleaning shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 What This Notebook Will *Not* Do\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain analytical discipline, Notebook 05 will not:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modify upstream features\n",
    "- Recompute lap timelines\n",
    "- Redefine pit or out laps\n",
    "- Infer driver or team intent\n",
    "- Speculate on strategy calls\n",
    "\n",
    "All inputs are treated as fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any assumption introduced will be:\n",
    "- stated explicitly\n",
    "- tested where possible\n",
    "- discussed as a limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of Notebook 05, we expect to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A catalog of detected undercut events\n",
    "- Quantified outcomes for each event\n",
    "- Summary statistics describing undercut effectiveness\n",
    "- Evidence supporting, weakening, or contradicting the undercut advantage hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The results are allowed to challenge common Formula 1 strategy narratives.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is designed to accept any outcome the data supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why This Notebook Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Undercut strategy is often discussed as if its effectiveness were self-evident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 treats that belief as a **testable hypothesis**, not an assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the rigor enforced in Notebooks 00–04:\n",
    "\n",
    "- conclusions reached here are grounded\n",
    "- limitations are explicit\n",
    "- disagreements can be traced to concrete analytical choices\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the point where the project stops preparing to analyze —  \n",
    "and starts **actually analyzing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Proceeding Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the analytical fulcrum of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent work, if any, will focus on:\n",
    "- robustness checks\n",
    "- sensitivity analysis\n",
    "- alternative definitions\n",
    "- extensions and counterfactuals\n",
    "\n",
    "None of that is meaningful unless this notebook is executed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the foundation sealed, we now proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Notebook 05 begins here.**\n"

    "# 🏁 Notebook 05 — Conclusion  \n",
    "## Undercut Detection, Evaluation & Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 is where this project crossed the line from **feature engineering** into **strategy analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to Notebook 04, the focus was on building a clean, deterministic, lap-level analytical foundation. Notebook 05 deliberately restricted itself to **one question only**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Is the undercut strategy actually worth it, or is it largely hype?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook did not attempt to answer that question narratively or heuristically. Instead, it constructed a pipeline that could **defend its answer under scrutiny**, with every assumption surfaced and every reduction justified by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What Notebook 05 Set Out to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline document defined five conceptual stages for undercut analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formalize what an undercut is**  \n",
    "2. **Detect undercut candidates**  \n",
    "3. **Construct fair evaluation windows**  \n",
    "4. **Evaluate outcomes quantitatively**  \n",
    "5. **Handle edge cases and validate assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook 05 implemented all five — but not always in the naïve way originally imagined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important lesson of this notebook is that **real Formula 1 data forces analytical clarity**.  \n",
    "Several initial “reasonable” assumptions failed when confronted with reality, and each failure reshaped the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Step-by-Step: What We Actually Did\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Undercut Definition (Cell 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "An undercut was formally defined as a **pairwise strategic interaction**, not a driver-level event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each undercut is uniquely identified by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `race_id`\n",
    "- `attacking_driver`\n",
    "- `defending_driver`\n",
    "- `pit_lap`\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition deliberately rejected vague interpretations such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Driver X attempted an undercut.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "and replaced them with a precise, falsifiable statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Driver A attempted to undercut Driver B on lap L in race R.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision eliminated ambiguity and ensured that every undercut could be traced back to exact laps, times, and competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Candidate Detection (Cell 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial attempts to detect only “clean” or “ideal” undercuts (green-flag racing, minimal noise) **failed completely**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This failure was not a bug — it exposed a flawed assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track status data is **event-based and sparse**\n",
    "- Green-flag laps are not uniformly labeled across the race timeline\n",
    "- Enforcing interpretation at detection time destroys signal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correction:**  \n",
    "Undercut detection was redesigned to be **lossless and inclusive**, focusing only on structural facts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Same race\n",
    "- Same pit lap\n",
    "- Attacking driver pits earlier\n",
    "- Defending driver remains on track\n",
    "\n",
    "This produced **876 narrative-aware undercut candidates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what a detection stage should do:\n",
    "> capture *potential* strategic interactions without prematurely judging them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Evaluation Window Construction (Cell 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next challenge was constructing **fair, like-for-like post-pit comparison windows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, enforcing green-flag logic too early resulted in near-zero evaluable events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:**  \n",
    "Green-flag status is not a *mechanical property* — it is an **analytical validity condition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the approach was revised:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Window construction enforced only **mechanical comparability**:\n",
    "  - same race\n",
    "  - same lap numbers\n",
    "  - no pit laps\n",
    "  - no out laps\n",
    "- Track status flags were **carried forward**, not used as filters\n",
    "- Partial windows were preserved when full windows were unavailable\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduced 876 candidates to **89 undercuts with valid evaluation windows**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduction was not data loss — it was **data qualification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each surviving undercut represents a situation where a fair, time-based comparison was actually possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Outcome Evaluation (Cell 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, outcomes were finally measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three metrics were computed deliberately, each serving a different analytical purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Metric (Option B):**  \n",
    "  Mean net time delta across post-pit laps  \n",
    "  → *Does the undercut pay off on average?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secondary Metric (Option A):**  \n",
    "  First post-pit lap delta  \n",
    "  → *Does the undercut feel immediately effective?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secondary Metric (Option C):**  \n",
    "  Best lap delta within the window  \n",
    "  → *What is the peak upside — the moment commentators remember?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the **primary metric** was allowed to determine `undercut_success`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prevented cherry-picking and ensured that “success” reflected sustained advantage, not isolated highlights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ Edge Case Handling & Context Validation (Cell 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline document stated:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Undercuts are meaningless under fully neutralized racing.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle was implemented **explicitly**, not implicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of assuming green-flag conditions, the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- tracked SC / VSC / RED overlap at the lap level\n",
    "- marked evaluation windows that contained **at least one competitive green lap**\n",
    "- avoided discarding events prematurely\n",
    "\n",
    "This produced a clear distinction between:\n",
    "- **mechanically evaluable undercuts**, and\n",
    "- **analytically interpretable contexts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, this step **validated context after measurement**, not before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 😮 What Surprised Us\n",
    "\n",
    "Several non-obvious truths emerged during this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most “potential undercuts” never become evaluable events\n",
    "- Strict interpretation too early destroys analytical signal\n",
    "- Mechanical validity must precede contextual judgment\n",
    "- Many undercuts that *look* promising fail to deliver sustained gains\n",
    "- The narrative power of the undercut is driven by **best-lap moments**, not by **average outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights could not have been discovered without allowing ambiguity to exist until it could be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 What the Data Now Safely Says\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of Notebook 05, we now have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **89 validated undercut events**\n",
    "- Each with:\n",
    "  - explicit attacker–defender pairing\n",
    "  - mechanically fair evaluation windows\n",
    "  - multiple outcome metrics\n",
    "  - transparent context flags\n",
    "\n",
    "All results are persisted to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- PostgreSQL (for BI and dashboards)\n",
    "- `data/final/` (for auditability and external review)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Every conclusion drawn downstream is traceable to raw laps, explicit rules, and validated assumptions.\n",
